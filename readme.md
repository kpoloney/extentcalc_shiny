# Extent Calculator

This is a simple shiny app to calculate linear extent in centimeters. Box types are those commonly used by the SFU Archives.

Partial boxes are calculated as a fraction of the box size based on the total number of files in the box and those in the archival unit being described. 

## Usage

The app can be accessed online at https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/extent_calculator/

It can be run locally through R using the shiny library and the command `shiny::runApp("app.R")`.
